// ARTICLE 1 – LICENSING OF THE SOFTWARE
1.1. LICENSE GRANT
1.1.1 Subject to the payment by the LICENSEE of the relevant charges and fees in respect of the Software licence, and the LICENSEE’s compliance with the provisions of this SLA, the LICENSOR grants to the LICENSEE a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty free, non-transferable licence as defined below. The licence is granted per-developer. This means
	The LICENSEE will need to purchase one licence for each Developer
	The LICENSEE does not need to purchase licences for Build Servers or Testers
	If the LICENSEE’s team grows, the LICENSEE will need to purchase additional licences.
The Licence grants the right to:
(a) download and store the Software and Documentation. The licence is per-developer, not per machine. This means that the Software can be installed on several computers owned by the same Developer (as long as only one machine is used at a time); and
(b) use the Software as a component in developing LICENSEE’s own desktop software applications, intranet sites and public websites (a “LICENSEE Application”); and
(c) publish or redistribute the Software in compiled “dll” form only to End-Users and only as a complete Licence Application of the LICENSEE Application;
(d) Unless expressly agreed otherwise, the Licence is granted solely for the Software object code.
(e) The LICENSEE may purchase Site-Licences that allow reproduction of the Software for unlimited developers at a single physical site.
(f)The Licence granted is royalty-free. The LICENSEE is free to copy and distribute the Software when embedded in LICENSEE Application free of charge, so long as
	LICENSEE is not creating a substantially similar product or component to SciChart, e.g. wrapping the SciChart library in a wrapper for distribution to multiple developers / departments, either for sale, or as part of an internal framework used by other developers in your organisation;
	End users are not developers who will be debugging and developing against LICENSEE code.
	These are both rare cases, but if LICENSEE is doing either of the above LICENSEE may need developer licences for each end-user, or an OEM or Site license.
1.1.2 The LICENSEE must not:
(a) copy or reproduce the Software or Documentation or any part of the Software or Documentation other than in accordance with the licence granted in this Article 1;
(b) sell, resell, rent, lease, loan, supply, distribute, redistribute, publish or re-publish the Software or Documentation or any part of the Software or Documentation, unless in accordance with Article 1.1.1 (b) and (c);
(c) modify, alter, adapt, translate or edit, or create derivative works of, the Software or Documentation or any part of the Software or Documentation, for purpose of making a software product which is significantly similar to the Software;
(d) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble the Software or Documentation or any part of the Software or Documentation;
(e) circumvent or remove or attempt to circumvent or remove the technological measures applied to the Software and Documentation for the purposes of preventing unauthorised use, providing that nothing in this Article 1.1.2. will prohibit or restrict the LICENSEE or any other person from doing any act expressly permitted by applicable Law (including any act expressly permitted by Section 296ZA of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988).
(f) distribute any part of the Source-Code ir the LICENSEE has purchased a source-code license
(g) The License herein granted conveys no right to grant sub-licences, except to the End-User of the LICENSEE Application, is not to be deemed transferable for any purpose and is indivisible and non-assignable except to a business successor of LICENSEE or with LICENSOR prior written approval.

(a) This may be in the form of written statement of compliance signed by the LICENSEE, or an electronic license audit report, stating compliance with the terms and conditions of the SLA, including but not limited to the number of licences held and the number of UI developers using the Software.
1.2. OTHER USERS
1.2.1 The LICENSEE may permit any employee of the LICENSEE to exercise the rights granted by the LICENSOR to the LICENSEE under Article 1.1.1., subject always to the restrictions set out in Article 1.1.2.
1.2.2 The LICENSEE must ensure that any person using the Software and/or Documentation is made aware of, and agrees to, the terms of this SLA.
1.3. UPDATES

The following information is provided to LICENSEE for information purpose only. The LICENSOR shall bear no responsibility if the following information becomes inaccurate.
